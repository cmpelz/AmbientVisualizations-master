TRICKS OF THE TRADE:
- most things you need are in the scripts folder
- if you're confused about what files are used when certain visualizations/simulations are run, look at their index.html file, it shows in order the files that are called
- both the simulations and visualizations call the same circles.js etc. found in the scripts/<whatever shape> folders
- we didn't use labeled_circles at all
- make sure your paths are correct in scripts/all/paths.js
- some variables carry over between files

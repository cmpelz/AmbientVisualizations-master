The order of the images in the shapes folders dictates which color images are used first.
We only use five different colors because there are only five appliances.
We tried to use standard and easily differentiable colors to represent these appliances.
In general, the order goes: green, red, yellow, blue, purple

'kitchen' contains images of the kitchen that are not colored to coordinate with the shapes.

'kitchen_copy' contains colored images of the kitchen where the light is included and the stove/oven are one item

'kitchen_separate' contains colored images of the kitchen with the stove and oven differentiated and the light not included -- used for visualization

'labeled_kitchen' is the same as 'kitchen_copy' except each appliance is labeled -- used for simulation
